      "prose": "Today I'm going to be talking about a topic that I think everyone can appreciate: namely how can we most palatably deal with the rise of AI that seems and is everywhere. Well, first of all the hard pill we have to swallow is that AI is inevitable --- it's not quite a bubble, but is over-hyped at times --- and it will infiltrate every aspect of our life within years (probably less than 15 to be conservative). Once we accept that, we naturally wonder how we should deal with that. My thesis is we need Safety and we need Humanity, realized in certain ways, to make this a future worth having."

      "prose": "So I'd like to start with Safety, as we've all heard this a countless number of times, Safety First, though I think you'll agree that we've also ignored that same another countless number of times.  But probably my favorite example of Safety in practice because it is so singularly exciting, fascinating, and terrifying at the same time is the Apollo 11 Moon Landing in 1969. This was really the epitome of a 0-1 situation: either boots touch the lunar surface or they don't. And there were a million very plausible ways you could fail. Add to that the national and scientific pressure and prestige, the fact that 3 highly valuable and respected human lives were at stake, and oh yes the whole world is watching on live TV. But the people at NASA really thought hard about this and prepared incredibly well for a huge number of failure scenarios, the vast majority of which thankfully never showed a hint of occuring. And you know they have their list of safety and engineering guidelines, of course, but I think of it from my perspective and it seems to me you can collect all that safety preparation in 3 principles which probably applies to any large, fault-tolerant system or mission, in particular our own mission to come to grips with AI. But I call these out as Frequent Recalibration, Loose Coupling, and a Backup Plan for Everything. ",

	  "prose": "So first, Frequent Recalibration. No system, no matter how well-designed, stays true to its purpose forever. It needs to be tuned and readjusted. And in the Apollo Mission nothing exhibited this more poignantly than the AGC, the Apollo Guidance Computer. It's a really beautiful 32kg chunk of copper and electronics, with this little interactive panel called the DSKY. There's a link here to a great lecture on this computer and a lot of what it did during the mission --- and believe me it got out of whack in numerous ways. In particular its  IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) reported the spacecraft's orientation, which is crucial to anything you're doing out there, and it had to be continually aligned via astronauts looking out the window and reading star positions with a sextant -- yes just like ancient mariners. Another great example of this was during the so-called P63 landing phase when the spacecraft was in position to lower to the surface at a controlled speed via its thrusters. Now remember you're falling rapidly towards the lunar surface at 5000ft altitude and you really do need to slow down, but you just don't fire the thrusters and hope for the best --- you measure and calibrate first, by firing at 10% thrust and observing whether the spacecraft rotates. If there is any rotation, you then adjust the position before retrying this exercise, and then eventually going to maximum thrust (actually 94%, but there's another safety reason for that). So recalibration --- obviously incredibly important for safety. Likewise with AI in our lives, we need to constantly recalibrate where we're going and how fast."

	  "prose":"The next principle I call Loose Coupling, or try to accommodate imperfection everywhere. And again I think a great example from the Apollo mission was the way the Gemini spacecraft would dock with a Target Vehicle -- I mean you have these two massive hunks of metal floating in space, how do you get them to couple together with sub-millimeter precision? And there's even a game here you can play to try this yourself in a simulation, it's quite challenging (I've done it at Kennedy Space Center I think) as you need to get the two ends very close without crashing into eachother, but the key is that they don't need to be perfectly aligned because you have magnets here that pull them to perfect alignment within a certain distance. You accommodate the imperfect way the human is inevitably going to steer these things. So what you've done here with this arrangement is you've smoothed out a possible single point of failure, i.e. the spacecraft misaligning with and damaging its docking station, which would you know scrap the whole mission. So when components need to come together, you make it soft. Likewise in our relationship with AI, we need to emphasize soft interfaces. Human-in-the-loop, which I talked about in my last INFORMS talk 10 years ago, you've all heard of by now, and is a great example of that."

My favorite here is called the Apollo Launch Escape System, which is a little side thruster that fires in case something were to go wrong with the enormous Saturn rocket: you want to decouple the lunar module and get the astronauts as quickly away as possible from the possibly-going-to-explode Saturn rocket, and sideways is your best bet. In AI, an example of a Plan B would be to have low or no-tech backup solutions, because if the AI has failed, then you can't trust any of the technology behind it which is probably controlling everything else hi-tech. And we'll get back to discuss this point later."

Yes, shocking things happen when you violate the Minimal Action Principle. Or two metal plates in space start attracting each other due to virtual photons, which spontaneously arise from the vacuum for a brief interval of time, violating energy conservation, before disappearing again. But during their brief lifetime they cause the plates to attract. And other things you may have heard of like Hawking Radiation, there is a huge list of weird Quantum Physics phenomena. The thing is, no one is really comfortable with Quantum Physics.

And the embeddings gradually converge. Now when all your embeddings converge you stop the process and look: you have vector algebra among the vectors exhibiting real logic.

No metallic computer can compete with that degree of ambiguity. And we  have finite lifespans and a tradition of passing on knowledge to our offspring --- every generation has a different zeitgeist, and thus the pool of social beliefs keeps churning and spewing out new things. Computers can also beget other computers but there is a priori no limit to their lifespans, so they stagnate. This is actually also Asimov's argument why humans are so good at taking over the galaxy versus other lifeforms with long stable lives and few offspring."
