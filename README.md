# Experimental Code for Tree-Based Immersive Presentations

## To run in your own environment
MAC OS:

$ npm install

$ npm run dev

Then open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/.

## To make your own presentation
1. Start crafting your own version of data/knowledge.json (an LLM can typically make this for you just by giving it the default example here and telling it what you want the talk to be about) and add a directory to data/examples to store your images, following the structure there. Hopefully the schema is self-explanatory.
2. Copy your main JSON file to data/knowledge.json and it should just work.
3. You will probably want to post-edit: add/fix images and links, adjust wording, editing nodes, etc. Give it your own touch.
4. Use an IDE such as VS Code with an AI Assistant (like Github Copilot) to make your life much easier. It can help you auto-complete nodes and widgets as you go.
5. Note if you're publishing this with Lovable (see below) you'll want to update your knowledge.json to reference images in the /public directory of your GitHub root. So if your images are in data/examples/MyProject you'll want to move them all to /public/examples/MyProject and add a '/' in front of all your file references.
